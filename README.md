# Installation steps:

## Backend
1. Verify the Python version; any version from 3.x should be suitable.
2. Run a Python virtual environment (venv) â€“ optional but recommended.
3. Install the required pip packages listed in requirements.txt.
4. Create a user and a PostgreSQL database with names specified in the app.py file (check the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` variable). You can modify default values, but ensure you update them in the app.py file.
5. Grant the newly created user privileges to the database.
6. Run the backend using the command 'python (path to file)app.py'. (Note: Please replace `(path to file)` in the commands with the actual path to the file.) You should see similar output:

```
